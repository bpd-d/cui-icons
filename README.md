# cui-icons
SVG icon pack for cUI libraries

Icons can be used also in other project, however they are lacking of style components on paths.
In order to make use of them in HTML following (or similar) CSS rules must be added:

``` css
svg {
        fill           : none;
        stroke         : black;
        stroke-opacity : 1;
        stroke-width   : 1px;
        stroke-linecap : round;
        stroke-linejoin: miter;
    }
```
